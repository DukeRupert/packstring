# Brand Voice Audit Findings -- Feb 2026

## First-Person Plural ("we"/"our"/"us") -- Site-Wide Issue
Found in: homepage heading ("Our Trips"), testimonials heading ("What Our Clients Say"), footer ("Contact Us", "We respond"), all five fishing trip descriptions in trips.go ("our jet boat", "We fish", "We troll", "We hike", "We offer"). Must convert to third-person narrator voice or use Forrest's name.

## Banned/Flagged Words Found
- "world-class" in trips.html hero subhead
- "unforgettable" in tripshub.go Packages card description
- "experience" used as noun in multiple locations (trips.go specialty, footer tagline, fishing.html bottom CTA)
- "Big Sky Country" in homepage intro heading (tourism-brochure voice)

## Superlatives Without Evidence
- "Montana's finest waters" (homepage intro)
- "Montana's best waters" (fishing hero, tripshub fishing card)
- "Montana's premier reservoirs" (lake trip description)
- "Montana's wildest terrain" (trips hub hero)
- "Your trusted guide for Montana's best hunting and fishing experiences" (footer)

## Missing Showman's Rule Hooks
- All three homepage trip cards are fact-only, no theatrical hook
- Trips hub cards same issue
- Approved rewrites provided in the audit review

## Pricing Format Issue
All five fishing trips use "From $X/person" -- functionally same as banned "starting at." Should state prices plainly or list the range.

## Weak Taglines
- "Classic Fly Fishing at Its Best" -- superlative without evidence
- "Something Different" -- vague
- "Big Water, Big Fish" -- generic, could be any lake in any state

## Strong Copy That Passed Review
- Homepage hero headline + subhead: matches voice guide example exactly
- Seasonal callout heading: "Now Booking: Summer 2026 Fishing Trips" -- clean
- "Book This Trip" CTA in trip-section partial: exact voice guide approved example
- "Boots in the Water, Rod in Hand" tagline: concrete, visual, strong
- "Missouri River -- Land of Giants" tagline: specific, earned
- Credentials display (license numbers): clean, factual, well-placed
